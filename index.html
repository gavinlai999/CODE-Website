Gavin enjoyed playing many games when he was younger such as Clash of Clans and Minecraft, however, as he got older, he started to play shootings games such as Fortnite and Valorant which he enjoyed even more. Gavin's childhood consisted of studying and gaming whenever he could. As time went on, his parents finally decided to move to Hacienda Heights which was where Gavin went to school for the rest of his childhood. </p>
