            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p id = 'secondparagraph1'>This picture was taken when Gavin was at his cousin's house during a birthday party where he had lots of fun.
            Gavin was only 7 years old when the picture was taken which is why he looks so young. He had a big smile on him
            because he loves to spend time with his family who also love to have lots of fun just like Gavin.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p id = 'secondparagraph2'>This is a picture of Optimus Prime from Transformers Rise of the Beast which recently came out. Optimus Prime is Gavin's favorite
            autobot(transformer) who inspires him to be a leader and become a hero that saves many lives.
            Gavin is still into Optimus Prime today
            because in the end of every Transformers movie, Optimus always gives a message/quote that
            would inspire Gavin to do great things in life.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p id = 'secondparagraph3'>The picture above is Gavin's favorite food. Ever since Gavin ate fried chicken when he was 5 years old, it changed him forever, there was no food that tasted better than fried chicken to Gavin.
                Wherever Gavin goes out to eat, he would always look for fried chicken on the menu before he tried to order anything else.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p id = 'secondparagraph4'>The very first collection Gavin bought from Miniso was the Sonny Angel collection which cost him a fortune. Each piece cost him 10 dollars to get which meant that buying the bundle cost him 100 dollars. Being obsessed with these collectibles was a bad habit already, however, it did not stop Gavin from purchasing as many as he could after how happy they made him. </p>
